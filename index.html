While I've got a solid background in UX/UI, I'm excited to refine my skills in design systems, information architecture, and digital strategy. My goal is to master the principles that make digital products not just functional, but truly intuitive and built to last.<br>
                        <br>
                        This journey is all about strengthening my strategic and systematic thinking. I want to build solutions that are not only user-centered but also consistent and ready for long-term growth. Every design choice I make will be purposeful, grounded in a deep understanding of what users need and what the business wants to achieve.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight: 400;display: flex; margin-bottom: 0px;">During my projects with Itaú/EBAC and EBAC's final course project, I gained practical, hands-on experience in the complete UX/UI design process. These experiences have made me a more empathetic, thorough, and user-focused designer.<br>
                        <br>
                        The first project, a UX/UI case study for Itaú, taught me to deconstruct user flows and identify pain points, such as app instability and difficulty viewing investments. By conducting research and creating a user journey, I learned to approach design with a focus on empathy and a deep understanding of the user. This experience has since shaped my design work, with a strong focus on creating clean, intuitive, and reliable interfaces that address real-world user challenges.<br>
                        <br>
                        The second project, a final course project, involved redesigning an outdated website for a public competitive exam company. This project allowed me to apply the full Double Diamond design process, from initial discovery and research to creating a final, accessible prototype. Using methods like benchmarking, user surveys, and usability tests, I learned to translate user pain points into effective design solutions.<br>
                        <br>
                        Combined, these experiences have significantly enhanced my ability to create robust, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing interfaces. I now approach my design work with a stronger focus on preventing errors and creating user-friendly systems that are reliable and truly address user needs.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight: 400;display: flex;">During my 3 years and 6 months as a QA Analyst, I gained a deep understanding of the user experience from a quality and functional perspective. I was responsible for ensuring that all systems and applications met high standards of usability, functionality, and performance. This role honed my attention to detail and taught me to anticipate user pain points and potential issues before they arise. By identifying and documenting bugs, I learned how to deconstruct user flows and system interactions, which in turn has made me a more empathetic and thorough as I discovered my passion for UX/UI Design.<br>
                        <br>
                        This experience made me now approach my design work with a stronger focus on preventing errors and creating robust, intuitive interfaces that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also reliable and user-friendly.</p>
